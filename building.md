Building Paper
====================
### Paper requires Java 8!
Download Java 8 [here from oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

Java 8 is strongly recommended for ALL servers. If your host is still using Java 6 or 7, please ask them to upgrade!

## Server Administrators
Server Admins do not need to build Paper to use it, as we provide a ready to use jar file!

Download latest Paper 1.9 [here](https://paperclip.emc.gs)

CI for previous builds: [here](https://ci.destroystokyo.com/job/PaperSpigot/)

This jar does not violate the DMCA against CraftBukkit as it does not ship the Minecraft Server. It distributes a patch file, that the jar will then download Minecraft Vanilla server for you, and apply the patches to it.

### Developers
Developers may download the [Paper repo](https://paperdev.emc.gs) and then run `./build.sh --jar` to build a jar file.

JDK8 is required.
