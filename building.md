Building Paper
====================
## Server Administrators
### PaperSpigot requires Java 8!
Server Admins do not need to build Paper to use it, as we provide a ready to use jar file [here](https://paperclip.emc.gs)
This jar does not violate the DMCA against CraftBukkit as it does not ship the Minecraft Server. It distributes a patch file, that the jar will then download Minecraft Vanilla server for you, and apply the patches to it.

### Developers
Developers may download the [Paper repo](https://paperdev.emc.gs) and then run ./build.sh --jar to build a jar file.

JDK8 is required.
