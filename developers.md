## Plugin Developers
Plugin developers may be interested in the API additions made by PaperSpigot to Spigot-API, and the Bukkit platform. They include:

- Player Affects Spawning API
    - Control whether the player will cause mobs to spawn
- TNT Source Location
    - Get the original source location of TNT and FallingBlock entities
- PlayerLocaleChangeEvent
    - An event that fires when a player changes their locale
- Player View Distance API
    - Dynamically set the server view distance, per-player
- BeaconEffectEvent
    - An event that fires when a player is affected by a Beacon's radius effect
- Get TPS API
    - An API to return the server's TPS, no more ugly reflection
