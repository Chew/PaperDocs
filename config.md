PaperSpigot Configuration Details
=================================
The paperspigot configuration file is ```paper.yml```. PaperSpigot uses this file, along with ```spigot.yml```, ```bukkit.yml```, and ```minecraft.properties``` to control your server's feature and performance options

## General Settings - Server-wide

- 'settings':
    - 'baby-zombie-movement-speed': 0.5
        - The speed at which baby zombies will move
        - The player moves at 0.1, for reference
    - 'limit-player-interactions': true
        - Whether or not the server should prevent people from spamming interaction packets to lag the server
    - 'load-permissions-yml-before-plugins': true
        - Load the servers permission.yml BEFORE plugins. Bukkit/Spigot behavior was after, resulting in plugins not seeing those permission in onEnable. Defaults to true. Set to false to go back to Bukkit behavior.
    - 'sleep-between-chunk-saves': false
        - Should server sleep between every chunk save. Will cause memory issues if you enable this.
    - 'enable-player-collisions': true
        - If disabled, Players should not be able to collide with each other. If enabled (default, vanilla), it will use the players scoreboard team setting. Setting this to false will not impact non player collisions unless you also enable allow-non-player-entities-on-scoreboards and then disable collision for that team.

- 'use-chunk-inhabited-timer': true
    - Should chunks have [Regional Difficulty](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Difficulty#Regional_difficulty) enabled. Setting this to false will ensure all chunks are treated equally. In Vanilla, the longer a player is in a chunk, the difficulty will rise.

    - How many ticks to despawn arrows from a non player. -1 will use the spigot.yml arrow despawn rate config.
- 'grass-spread-tick-rate': 1
    - How many ticks between each grass block ticks in attempt to spread. Raising this value will improve performance but slow down grass spreading. 1 is vanilla (every tick)
- 'keep-spawn-loaded-range': <varies>
    - Configure how far your spawn should keep chunks loaded. Default value will be based on your view distance for that world defined in spigot.yml, capped to 8. However the value itself is not capped to 8, just the default if you have not set it. Once set, you may go over 8 chunks. Recommended 0-1 for development servers and unused worlds to drastically speed up server start up time!
- 'allow-non-player-entities-on-scoreboards': false
    - Vanilla defaults this to true, however when this setting is false, Paper will drastically reduce the performance impact of non player collisions. You would only ever need to set this to true if you intend to use /scoreboard team join teamname @e syntax to force non players into a team. It is recommended to not set this to true unless you know you are trying to do something that this blocks.
