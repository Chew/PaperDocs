Features and Changes
====================
- Vanished Players

    - Undead horses can be leashed, as though they are just normal horses, if you so want them to be
- Squid Spawn Heights
    - The spawning height of squid entities can be altered via our config file

- Fishing time ranges
    - The amount of time it takes for a fish to be caught can be altered

- World Generation Settings
    - Numerous world generator settings can be controlled from within PaperSpigot
