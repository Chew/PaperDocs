Contributing
============

Thanks for looking at helping out.

Syntax
======

PaperDocs uses the reStructuredText markup syntax for its documentation.
It may appear similar to markdown at first glance but it is quite different.

For more information about the syntax and how to use it, please see the
[reStructuredText site](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) for docs and
a quick reference guide.

Formatting
==========

**Spaces** not tabs. RST will accept either but we'd prefer you to stick
to spaces.

**80** column line limit. Mostly to keep editing easy for all users. Exceptions
permitted for end of line links, tables, and other large RST blocks. This is a
soft guideline.

Language & Locale
=================

Documentation should be submitted in English and conform to the en_US locale.
This is another soft guideline, here mostly just to swiftly end any debates.

Scope
=====

We'd prefer you keep large PRs to a single documentation area. If you're adding
multiple sections, for example one on keeping plugins up-to-date and another on
developer APIs, we'd prefer they be separate pull requests.
